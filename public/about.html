<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Kareem. I’m passionate about programming, technology, and building ideas from scratch. I enjoy turning
simple concepts into real working applications, especially in web and mobile development. For me, writing code is not
just a skill — it’s a way to create, express, and leave something meaningful behind.</p>

<p>I also enjoy gaming and exploring digital worlds, whether competitive or open-world. Gaming taught me patience,
strategy, and quick decision-making. Outside of programming, I like learning new things every day — whether it’s related
to business, design, or new technologies.</p>

<p>Even though I like working independently and focusing deeply, I also value teamwork with people who share similar goals.
My aim is to keep improving, build solid projects, and create a future where I can do what I love while living
comfortably. The journey might be long, but I’m walking it step by step with confidence.</p>
